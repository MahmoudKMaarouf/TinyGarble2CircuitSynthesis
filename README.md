Circuit Synthesis for the TinyGarble2: Smart, Efficient, and Scalable Yao's Garbled Circuit. 
=======

This repository contains the synthesis library (from the original [TinyGarble](https://github.com/esonghori/TinyGarble) [1]) and the Verilog source code for the program interface of the TinyGarble2 framework. 
It also contains a set of Benchamrks functions used to evaluate TinyGarble2 for correctness or performance. 
In addition, it provides the parser to convert the synthesized netlist to the circuit format readable by TintGarble2. 
The repository can also be used to generate custom netlists for TinyGarble2.
